# Spring Boot Reference Guide

## Spring Boot Overview

Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that streamlines the process of building production-ready, stand-alone Spring applications. Its primary goal is to simplify configuration and deployment by providing sensible defaults, embedded servers, and a suite of tools that reduce boilerplate and accelerate development.

Key benefits include:
- **Auto-configuration:** Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the libraries present on the classpath, minimizing the need for manual setup.
- **Standalone applications:** You can create executable JARs or WARs with embedded servers (such as Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow), eliminating the need for external application servers.
- **Opinionated defaults:** Spring Boot provides pre-configured settings and conventions, allowing you to get started quickly while still offering flexibility for customization.
- **Production-ready features:** Built-in support for metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration helps you move applications to production with confidence.
- **Minimal configuration:** With features like Spring Boot Starters and auto-configuration, you can focus on business logic rather than infrastructure code.

Spring Boot is designed to work seamlessly with the broader Spring ecosystem, making it an ideal choice for both new projects and modernizing existing Spring applications. Its emphasis on convention over configuration and rapid development has made it a popular framework for building microservices, REST APIs, and cloud-native applications.

## Spring Initilizr

Spring Initializr is an online tool and service that helps you quickly bootstrap new Spring Boot projects with minimal setup. It provides a user-friendly web interface (https://start.spring.io) where you can select your project’s dependencies, packaging, Java version, and other settings, then generate a ready-to-use project structure.

Key features and workflow:
- **Dependency selection:** Choose from a wide range of Spring Boot starters and third-party libraries to include in your project. This ensures that your build file (Maven `pom.xml` or Gradle `build.gradle`) is pre-configured with the necessary dependencies.
- **Project metadata:** Specify details like group, artifact, name, description, and package name, which are used to generate your project’s structure and configuration files.
- **Build tool and language:** Select between Maven or Gradle, and choose your preferred programming language (Java, Kotlin, or Groovy).
- **Packaging and Java version:** Decide whether you want a JAR or WAR file, and set the Java version to match your development environment.
- **Download and import:** Once configured, you can download a ZIP file containing the generated project. Simply extract and import it into your IDE to start coding immediately.

Spring Initializr is also integrated into popular IDEs (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and VS Code), allowing you to generate new projects directly from your development environment.

By handling the initial setup and dependency management, Spring Initializr lets you focus on writing business logic rather than boilerplate configuration.

## Auto Configuration

Auto-configuration is a core feature of Spring Boot that automatically sets up your application based on the libraries and settings detected on the classpath. This reduces the need for manual configuration and allows you to get started quickly with sensible defaults.

How it works:
- **Classpath inspection:** Spring Boot scans the classpath for specific libraries (such as Spring MVC, Data JPA, or Thymeleaf) and applies configuration that matches common use cases for those technologies.
- **Conditional configuration:** Auto-configuration classes use conditional logic (e.g., `@ConditionalOnClass`, `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`) to ensure that beans are only created when appropriate, avoiding conflicts with your own custom configurations.
- **Customization:** You can override any auto-configured bean by defining your own bean of the same type. Additionally, properties in `application.properties` or `application.yml` files allow you to fine-tune or disable specific auto-configuration features.
- **@EnableAutoConfiguration:** This annotation (usually included via `@SpringBootApplication`) triggers the auto-configuration process. You can exclude specific auto-configurations if needed.
- **Transparency:** Spring Boot provides the `spring-boot-autoconfigure` module, which contains all auto-configuration logic. You can review the source or use the `spring-boot-actuator` to see which auto-configurations are active in your application.

Auto-configuration is designed to work for most scenarios out of the box, but always allows for explicit configuration when your application has unique requirements. This balance of convention and flexibility is a key reason for Spring Boot’s popularity.

### Example: Application Bootstrapping

The application starts from a main class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, which implicitly triggers the component scanning and auto-configuration processes. The `SpringApplication.run()` method then bootstraps the context.

[DemoApplication.java](file:///c:/Users/manua/source/repo/_references/__study_notes/spring01-example/src/main/java/com/example/demo/DemoApplication.java#L6-L11)
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
	}
```

## Common Spring Boot Starters

Spring Boot starters are curated dependency descriptors that simplify adding commonly used libraries to your project. By including a starter, you automatically pull in a set of compatible dependencies for a specific functionality, reducing manual dependency management.

Some of the most widely used starters include:

- **spring-boot-starter-web:**  
  Provides everything needed to build web applications, including RESTful services. It brings in Spring MVC, embedded Tomcat (by default), Jackson for JSON processing, and validation support. Ideal for building APIs and web frontends.

- **spring-boot-starter-data-jpa:**  
  Simplifies database access using Spring Data JPA and Hibernate. It sets up JPA repositories, transaction management, and sensible defaults for connecting to relational databases. Use this starter for applications that need ORM-based data persistence.

- **spring-boot-starter-actuator:**  
  Adds production-ready features such as health checks, metrics, application info, and environment endpoints. The actuator exposes operational endpoints (e.g., `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/metrics`) that help monitor and manage your application in real time.

- **spring-boot-starter-test:**  
  Bundles testing libraries and utilities for Spring Boot applications. It includes JUnit, Mockito, Hamcrest, and Spring TestContext, providing a comprehensive setup for unit, integration, and slice testing.

Using starters ensures that you get a consistent, compatible set of dependencies, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing versions. You can mix and match starters as needed to fit your application's requirements.

### Example: Defining Starters in Gradle

Below is a snippet demonstrating how these starters and utilities like Lombok are explicitly imported into the project via `build.gradle.kts`:

[build.gradle.kts](file:///c:/Users/manua/source/repo/_references/__study_notes/spring01-example/build.gradle.kts#L21-L30)
```kotlin
dependencies {
	implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa")
	implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-webmvc")
	compileOnly("org.projectlombok:lombok")
	annotationProcessor("org.projectlombok:lombok")
	testImplementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa-test")
	testImplementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-webmvc-test")
	testCompileOnly("org.projectlombok:lombok")
	testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher")
	testAnnotationProcessor("org.projectlombok:lombok")
```

## Lombok

Lombok is a Java library that helps reduce boilerplate code by automatically generating common methods and constructors at compile time using simple annotations. While not specific to Spring, Lombok is widely used in Spring Boot projects to keep code concise and readable.

Common Lombok features:
- **@Getter / @Setter:** Generates getter and setter methods for fields, reducing repetitive code in data classes.
- **@ToString, @EqualsAndHashCode:** Automatically creates `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` methods.
- **@NoArgsConstructor, @AllArgsConstructor, @RequiredArgsConstructor:** Generates constructors with no arguments, all arguments, or required (final) fields, respectively.
- **@Data:** A convenience annotation that bundles `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@ToString`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, and `@RequiredArgsConstructor` for typical data-holding classes.
- **@Builder:** Implements the builder pattern for object creation, making it easier to construct complex objects in a readable way.
- **@Slf4j:** Adds a logger instance to your class, simplifying logging setup.

Lombok integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot, especially for model, DTO, and entity classes. It helps keep your codebase clean and focused on business logic, but be aware that IDE support requires installing a Lombok plugin.

### Example: Lombok in Practice

By adding `@Data` and `@NoArgsConstructor` to an entity, Lombok automatically provides setters, getters, the required arguments constructor, and a default constructor (which is strictly needed for JPA Entities).

[User.java](file:///c:/Users/manua/source/repo/_references/__study_notes/spring01-example/src/main/java/com/example/demo/entity/User.java#L20-L24)
```java
@Data // tells Lombok to provide setters, getters, required args constructor, and more
@NoArgsConstructor // needed for Entity decorator
@Entity // indicates the class should be mapped to a table in our database
@Table(name = "users") // if you want to change the name of your table specify it in the decorator
public class User {
```

## Dev Tools

Spring Boot DevTools is a set of utilities aimed at improving the developer experience by enabling faster feedback and productivity during application development.

Key features include:
- **Automatic restart:** Monitors classpath resources and automatically restarts the application whenever files change. This allows you to see code changes reflected almost instantly, without a manual restart.
- **LiveReload integration:** Works with supported browsers and IDE plugins to automatically refresh the browser when static resources (like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript) are updated.
- **Enhanced property defaults:** Enables development-friendly settings, such as disabling template caching and enabling detailed error messages, to streamline the development process.
- **Remote debugging:** Supports remote update and restart capabilities, making it easier to test changes in different environments.
- **Conditional activation:** DevTools is automatically disabled in production environments, so it won’t impact performance or security when you deploy your application.

To use DevTools, simply add the `spring-boot-devtools` dependency to your project. DevTools is designed to speed up the development cycle, reduce context-switching, and help you iterate quickly on your Spring Boot applications.

## Spring Environments

Spring Environments provide a flexible way to manage configuration and behavior across different stages of your application's lifecycle, such as development, testing, and production.

Key concepts:
- **Profiles:**  
  Spring profiles allow you to group configuration and beans under specific names (e.g., `dev`, `test`, `prod`). You can activate one or more profiles to control which beans and settings are loaded. Profiles are typically set via the `spring.profiles.active` property in `application.properties`, environment variables, or command-line arguments.

- **Externalized Configuration:**  
  Spring Boot supports external configuration through property files (`application.properties` or `application.yml`), environment variables, command-line arguments, and more. This makes it easy to adjust settings without changing code.

- **Property Hierarchy:**  
  Spring Boot loads configuration properties in a specific order, allowing overrides at different levels (e.g., command-line arguments override environment variables, which override property files).

- **Profile-specific Properties:**  
  You can create profile-specific configuration files (e.g., `application-dev.properties`, `application-prod.yml`) to customize settings for each environment. Spring automatically loads the appropriate file based on the active profile.

- **@Profile Annotation:**  
  Use the `@Profile` annotation to conditionally register beans for specific environments, ensuring that only relevant components are loaded.

Spring Environments help you build robust, portable applications that adapt seamlessly to different deployment scenarios, making configuration management straightforward and maintainable.
